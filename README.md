# mtsum

A parallel checksum utility using a Merkle tree, designed for huge files.

## Motivation

With the latest PCIe 4.0 and 5.0 SSDs, a single processor thread is insufficient to fully utilize their bandwidth.
This utility leverages multiple threads to compute a fileâ€™s checksum in parallel using a Merkle tree structure, 
enabling efficient checksum calculations for large files in a reasonable time.


## Usage
`Usage: mtsum [--help] [--version] [-p processors] [-a algorithm] path`

## Building
### Prerequisites
1. CMake 3.20 or higher
2. vcpkg
3. make or ninja
4. Any C++ compiler that supports C++20 or higher

### Dependencies
